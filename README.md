## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on offline and on-premise use cases for using local open-source machine learning models
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently tinkering with a raspberry pi zero, and trying to push myself to learn soldering.     
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Image generation, Machine Learning workflows, retro video games or Bionicle
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: akazmi.public@gmail.com or LinkedIn: https://ca.linkedin.com/in/arslankazmi


I also like to tinker with AI related side projects at home. Since I have a background in text-to-image generation systems I've been experimenting with tools like text-generation-webui, llama.cpp, ollama, etc to run AI services locally. I like getting disparate tools, libraries and languages to interact in interesting ways to build solutions to problems I find interesting.

- I have a large breadth of knowledge with regards to the fundamentals of AI and deep learning models. I've studied their architectural and mathematical foundations as well
- My unique collaborative degree program trained me to not only think of how AI solutions are created but also why and when not to do so ethically. I believe that if we do not consider the ethical implications of our products we run the risk of loosing long-term benefits in the chasing of short-term financial gain.
- I'm detail-oriented and consider the whole picture and long-term ramifications of anything I design or program. I like to anticipate problems and plan solutions accordingly, especially for deployment scenarios.
- I'm hungry to learn from those who are more experienced than me, and enjoy passing on my knowledge and skills as well.
